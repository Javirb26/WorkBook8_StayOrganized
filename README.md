# Stay Organized - ToDo List Web Application

## Overview
Welcome to the Stay Organized ToDo List Web Application, a dynamic and user-friendly platform designed to help individuals keep track of their tasks and manage their time efficiently. This project centers around building a website that allows users to maintain a list of tasks they need to accomplish, complete with categories, descriptions, deadlines, and priority levels.


## Features

* View ToDo Tasks: Users can view a list of their tasks, each detailed with a category, description, deadline, and priority status.
* Add ToDo Tasks: Users can easily add new tasks to their list, assigning them a category, description, deadline, and priority level.


## Example Task:

```
Category: "Personal Task"
Description: "Finish studying for ENG 211 exam"
Deadline: "2022-12-15"
Priority: "Medium"

```


## Technical Details
* REST API Integration: The website interfaces with a REST API, providing seamless access to a back-end data store.

* Data Store: The back-end data store contains user information and their corresponding ToDo tasks.

* User-Specific Interaction: The application allows for viewing and adding tasks specific to a registered user.
## Primary Objectives

1. Viewing Tasks: Enable users to view their list of tasks in an organized and intuitive manner.

2. Adding Tasks: Provide a simple and efficient interface for users to add new tasks to their list.

3. Creating User: Allow users to sign up or create a user to then add todo tasks to later on.
